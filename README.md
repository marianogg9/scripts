This repo contains some scripts I wrote to solve a few minor tasks.

Each folder contains a separate README file explaining a bit further.

**Disclaimer** 

I'm using this code snippets as practice and by no means using them for production or commercial activities. If anything looks off, just let me know.

Thank you and I hope this helps to anyone looking for examples.
